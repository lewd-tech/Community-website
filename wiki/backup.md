# Backing up data

This page aims to explain how to back up your data to either your cloud or an external drive, and why you should regularly back up your files.

## What do you need to back up?

It mostly depends on your preference, but you can start with your personal documents, photos, videos. These should be backed up regularly in case you lose them.

## Why do I need to back up my files?

Some updates, software bugs or malware could delete your data, your computer's drive could fail at some point, taking backups is useful when you regularly modify system files or when you format your disks frequently.

It's safer to store data in multiple places in case something happens to your computer's drive.

## The 3-2-1 Backup rule

The 3-2-1 rule is keeping 3 copies of your data, two on different storage mediums (your computer's drive and a backup drive for example) and one on the cloud.

For instance, if you have File X on your computer's main drive, you have to create another copy to put on your backup drive and/or on the cloud. Now you have 3 copies of File X.

## Backup locally

### Using an external drive

If you have an external drive, you could use it to backup your files by transferring your files to it. Your external drive could also include a backup software made by the drive's manufacturer, you can use that to back up your files.

### Using File History (Windows 10)

File History is a tool which automatically makes backups of your files. You can keep track of each file's revision by using the Previous Versions tab in a file's properties window or by right clicking on a file then selecting "Restore previous versions", and you can also choose when to back up files and when to remove the backups.

#### Add a drive to File History

- Open Settings.
- Go to Update & Security > Backup.
- Add a drive to File History in order to use as a backup drive.

### Using System Image Backup

You can use System Image Backup to back up your system image. A system image is basically an image of the current state of the operating system stored in a file. You can use these system images to revert the system to a previous state.

## Backup to a cloud service

You can also back up your data on a cloud service (for example: OneDrive, Google Drive etc...), this solution could be better in case you lose your backup drive.
